	<h2>POC Summary</h2>
	This is a "static" POC, of an Angular 15 based replacement for the Swing based desktop application. It's one such POC, and covers specific attributes
	below. Only a small amount of links/functionality will be simulated.
	<br><br>
	<h3>Attributes</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>A sample Angular Material UI components based layout, with some the common/popular widgets in that library</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>This UI concept attempts to match some of the existing layout, without using MDI (Multiple Document Interface)</li>
	      <li><b>Note</b>: Colors/fonts are just one example. These are obviously customizable and for graphics designer(s) to improve on.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <li>Simulated user login, with just one static user allowed. User: cfo, Password: admin</li>
	  <li>Best practice Angular application components structure (LIFT best practices)</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>See <a target="new" href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/angular-basics-tips-structuring-angular-project">Basics tips for structuring an angular project</a></li>
	    </ul>
	  <li>Multi-stage Dockerfile, which builds same image for all environments</li>
	      <ul>
	      <li><b>Note</b>: An environment variable is passed to the container launch (ex: docker run, or AWS ECS) and respective properties file copied from "assets"" on load (ex: dev, qa, prod).</li>
	    </ul>
	</ul>
